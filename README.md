# Development-of-a-Low-Latency-Trading-System
Design and implement a simplified low-latency trading system using C++. The system will process orders, execute trades,
and update the order book while minimizing latency.

Project Structure
1. Order Book Management

Manages buy and sell orders in an efficient data structure.
Handles matching of orders based on price and time priority.
2. Order Matching Engine

Matches incoming buy and sell orders.
Executes trades if matching orders are found.
3. Network Layer

Simulates the receiving and sending of orders via a low-latency messaging system.
Uses efficient socket programming techniques.
4. Latency Optimization

Implements multithreading for concurrent order processing.
Optimizes memory usage and data structures for speed.

This project simulates the core functionality of a low-latency trading system, focusing on order management, matching, and execution. 
While simplified, the code demonstrates key concepts such as data structure optimization, multithreading, and real-time processing,
which are crucial in developing high-performance trading systems.
